"""CC SessionStart watch-seed (AIR-56 follow-up): point the FileChanged
watcher at the ai-rules memory pool.

Why a seed script: FileChanged matcher seeds are cwd-scoped literal filenames,
and watchPaths must be absolute paths (CC mirror hooks.md SessionStart
Decision Control), so the only way to watch the pool is a SessionStart hook
returning absolute `watchPaths`. The pool lives in-repo at .agents/memory/
(AIR-54 S1 migration) — derived __file__-relative, never from cwd. This script
lists pool entries (top-level .md, excluding MEMORY.md and _-prefixed files —
the same entry filter `memory_hook_common.is_pool_entry` applies, so we never
watch files the dirty sensor would drop).

Always exits 0; pool missing -> stderr hint + empty watch list; pool empty
-> empty watch list (harmless no-op). Hook runtime is python 3.9 — no 3.10+
syntax in this file.
